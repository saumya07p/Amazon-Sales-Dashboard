# Amazon-Sales-Dashboard

The Amazon Sales Dashboard provides an overview of sales performance across various products and regions. It offers insights into total sales, individual sales count, and seller distribution, making it easy to track performance across different cities and states. This would be beneficial for monitoring sales trends, identifying top-performing regions, and assessing product demand in specific areas.
